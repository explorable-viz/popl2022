\section{Problem overview}
\label{sec:problem-overview}

We wish to provide ``linking'', or coordinated views \cite{tobiasz09}, in an
application-independent way, removing much of the burden associated with
implementing this feature, whilst simultaneously making it more uniformly
available. The theoretical foundation of the work is our own prior work on
dynamic dependency analysis and provenance \cite{perera16d, ricciotti17}; in
contrast to prior work on provenance in data visualisation \cite{callahan06},
our approach is much more fine-grained and is able to associate specific parts
of the data or code with parts of a visualisation in a precise way. While the
theoretical technique is proven, this approach has to the best of our knowledge
not yet been applied to data visualisation.
