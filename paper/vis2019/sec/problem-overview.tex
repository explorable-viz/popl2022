\section{Problem overview}
\label{sec:problem-overview}

Our framework provides infrastructure for ``linking'', or multiple-coordinated
views \cite{tobiasz09}, in an application-independent way. The theoretical
foundation of the work is our own prior work on dynamic dependency analysis and
provenance \cite{perera16d, ricciotti17}; in contrast to prior work on
provenance in data visualisation \cite{callahan06}, our approach is much more
fine-grained and is able to associate specific parts of the data or code with
parts of a visualisation in a precise way. While the theoretical technique is
proven, this approach has never been applied to data visualisation before.
