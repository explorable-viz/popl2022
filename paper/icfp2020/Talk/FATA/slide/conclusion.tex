\frametitle{Conclusion}
Demand is an inherently time-varying, compositional notion.
\begin{itemize}
\item Processing changes in demand should be part of the execution model.
\item A first step is a semantics where the active demand is made explicit.
\end{itemize}

Reactive and incremental languages (FRP, self-adjusting computation)
tend to emphasise dynamic input rather than dynamic demand.
