\section{Proofs: Core language}

\subsection{Conventions}

The symbol ${\qedLocal}$ indicates that a proof obligation is being discharged, and IH
stands for ``inductive hypothesis''. We make free use of the fact that all term constructors
preserve and reflect $\leq$, so that for example $\exCons{u}{u'} \leq
\exCons{v}{v'}$ if and only if $u \leq v$ and $u' \leq v'$.
