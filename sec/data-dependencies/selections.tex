\subsection{Lattices of selections}
\label{sec:data-dependencies:lattices-of-selections}

Our approach to representing selections is shown in \figref{core-syntax-selection}. The basic idea is to parameterise the type $\Set{Val}$ of values by a (bounded) lattice $\Ann{A}$ of \emph{selection states} $\alpha$. We add selection states to Booleans, integers, records and lists; while it would present no complications to equip closures with a selection state too, for present purposes we are only interested in dependencies between first-order data, so closures are not (directly) selectable, although they do have selectable parts. Moreover closures must capture the \emph{ambient availability} (explained in \secref{data-dependencies:forward-eval} below), which is also a selection state $\alpha$. We parameterise the type $\Set{Term}$ of terms in the same way, but only add selection states to the term constructors corresponding to selectable values, allowing us to trace data dependencies back to expressions that appear in the source code. We return to this in \secref{surface-language}.

\input{fig/core-language/slicing/syntax}

\vspace{-3mm}
The fact that $\Ann{A}$ is a bounded lattice means it has top and bottom elements $\top$ and $\bot$ representing fully selected/unselected, plus meet and join operations $\meet$ and $\join$ for combining selection information, with $\top$ and $\bot$ as their respective units. In \figref{introduction:data-linking}, the \kw{data} field of \kw{BarChart} expects a list of records with fields \kw{x} and \kw{y}, mapping strings representing categorical data to floats determining the height of the corresponding bar; the record computed for China is $\exRec{\bind{\kw{x}}{\kw{"China"}} \concat \bind{\kw{y}}{\kw{295.3}}}$. The two-point lattice $\Bool \eqdef \Lattice{\set{\TT,\FF}}{\TT}{\FF}{\wedge}{\vee}$ can be used to represent the selection of the field $\kw{y}$ within this record as $\annRec{\bind{\kw{x}}{\annStr{\kw{"China"}}{\FF}} \concat \bind{\kw{y}}{\annInt{\kw{295.3}}{\TT}}}{\FF}$, indicating that the number $\exInt{\kw{295.3}}$ is selected, but that neither the string $\exStr{\kw{"China"}}$, nor the record itself, is selected.

Because lattices are closed under component-wise products, we often write $(\alpha, \beta) \leq (\alpha', \beta')$ to mean that $\alpha \leq \alpha'$ and $\beta \leq \beta'$. This also suggests more interesting lattices of selections, such as vectors of Booleans to represent multiple selections simultaneously, which might be visualised using different colours (as in \figref{introduction:data-linking}).

\subsubsection{Selections of a value}
\label{sec:data-dependencies:selections}

The analyses which follow will be defined with respect to a fixed computation, and so we will often need to talk about the selections of a given value. To make this notion precise, consider that the raw (unselectable) syntax described in \secref{core-language} can be recovered from a selectable term via an erasure operation $\erase{\param}: \ValF{\Ann{A}} \to \ValF{\Unit}$ which forgets the selection information, where $\Unit$ is the trivial one-point lattice. We refer to $\erase{v}$ as the \emph{shape} of $v$. Allowing $\raw{u}, \raw{v}$ from now on to range over raw values, and reserving $u, v$ for selectable values, we can then define:

\begin{definition}[Selections of $\raw{v}$]
   Define $\Sel{\raw{v}}{A}$ to be the set of all values $v \in \ValF{\Ann{A}}$ with shape $\raw{v}$, i.e.
   ~that erase to $\raw{v}$.
\end{definition}

Since its elements have a fixed shape, the pointwise comparison of any $v, v'$ in $\Sel{\raw{v}}{A}$ using the partial order $\leq$ of $\Ann{A}$ is well defined, as is the pointwise application (zip) of a binary operation~\cite{gibbons17}. It should therefore be clear that if $\Ann{A}$ is a lattice, then $\Sel{\raw{v}}{A}$ is also a lattice, with $\top_{\raw{v}}$, $\bot_{\raw{v}}$, $\meet_{\raw{v}}$, and $\join_{\raw{v}}$ defined pointwise. For example, if $u$ and $u'$ have the same shape and $v$ and $v'$ have the same shape, the join of the lists $(\annCons{u}{v}{\alpha})$ and $(\annCons{u'}{v'}{\alpha'})$ is defined and equal to $\annCons{(u \join u')}{(v \join v')}{\alpha \join \alpha'}$. Similarly, the top element of $\Sel{\raw{v}}{A}$ is the selection of $\raw{v}$ which has $\top$ at every selection position. (We omit the $\raw{v}$ indices from the lattice operations if it is clear which lattice is being referred to.) The notion of the ``selections'' of $\raw{v}$ extends to the other syntactic forms.

\subsubsection{Environment selections and hole equivalence}

The notion of a ``selection'' of $\raw{v}$ also extends pointwise to environments, so that $\Sel{\raw{\rho}}{A}$ means the set of selectable environments $\rho'$ of shape $\raw{\rho}$, where the variables in $\rho'$ are bound to selections of the corresponding variables in $\raw{\rho}$. One challenge arises from the pointwise use of $\join$ to combine environment selections. Since environments contain other environments recursively through closures, environment join is a very expensive operation if treated naively. One implementation option is to employ an efficient representation of values which are fully unselected, which is the case for the majority of bindings in an environment.

We therefore enrich the set of selectable values $\ValF{\Ann{A}}$ with a distinguished element \emph{hole}, written $\hole$, which is an alternative notation for $\bot_{\raw{v}}$ for any $\raw{v}$, i.e.~the selectable value of shape $\raw{v}$ which has $\bot$ at every selection position. The equivalence of $\hole$ to any such bottom element is established explicitly by the preorder order defined in \figref{data-dependencies:leq}: the first rule always allows $\hole$ on the left-hand side of $\leq$, and other rules allow $\hole$ on the right-hand side of $\leq$ as long as all the selections that appear on the left-hand side are $\bot$. (The rules for recursive definitions $h$, eliminators $\sigma$ and terms $e$ are analogous and are omitted.) If we write $\eq$ for the equivalence relation induced by $\leq$ on selectable values, which we call \emph{hole-equivalence}, it should be clear that $\hole \join v \eq v$ and $\hole \meet v \eq \hole$. This means the join of two selections $v, v'$ of $\raw{v}$ can be implemented efficiently, whenever one selection is $\hole$, by simply discarding $\hole$ and returning the other selection without further processing.

\begin{definition}[Hole equivalence]
   Define $\eq$ as the intersection of $\leq$ and $\geq$.
\end{definition}

Because $\hole$ is equivalent to $\bot_{\raw{v}}$ for any $\raw{v}$, all such bottom elements are hole-equivalent. For example, the selectable value $\annCons{\hole}{\hole}{\top}$ is hole-equivalent to $\annCons{5_{\bot}}{\hole}{\top}$, but also to $\annCons{6_{\bot}}{{\exNil_{\bot}}}{\top}$, and so the last two selections, even though they have different shapes, are hole-equivalent by transitivity. In practice we only use the hole ordering to compare selections with the same shape.
