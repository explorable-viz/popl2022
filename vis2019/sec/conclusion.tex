It's great..

\begin{comment}
There are a number of challenges associated with making our approach practical
and appealing to actual data scientists. A central usability challenge is
visualising these complex relationships between the various parts of a
visualisation and the relevant data and/or visualisation code. This is
essentially a higher-order visualisation problem: visualising information about
the provenance of visualisations. Ideas from temporal data visualisation
\cite{bach16}, data-driven storytelling \cite{bach18}, and ``literate''
visualisation \cite{wood19} may inform our efforts here.
