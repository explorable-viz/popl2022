   We present new language-based dynamic analysis techniques for linking visualisations and other structured outputs to data in a fine-grained way, allowing a user to interactively explore how data attributes map to visual or other output elements by selecting (focusing on) substructures of interest. This can help both programmers and end-users understand how data sources and complex outputs are related, which can be a challenge even for someone with expert knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach builds on bidirectional program slicing techiques based on Galois connections, which provide desirable round-tripping properties.

   Unlike the prior work in program slicing, our approach allows selections to be negated. In this setting, the bidirectional analysis has a De Morgan dual, which can be used to link different outputs generated from the same input. This offers a principled language-based foundation for a popular interactive visualisation feature called \emph{brushing and linking} where selections in one chart automatically select corresponding elements in another related chart. Although such view coordination features are valuable comprehension aids, they tend be to hard-coded into specific applications or libraries, or require programmer effort.
