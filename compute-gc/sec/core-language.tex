Here evaluation produces not only a value $v$ but also a monotonic function $\phi: \Below{v} \to \Below{(\rho,e)}$ which maps slices of $v$ to slices of $(\rho,e)$. The $\lambda$ used to denote functions in the meta-language must not be confused with the $\uplambda$ used in the syntax of functions in the object language.
