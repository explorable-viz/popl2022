## Cover letter

### Substantive changes

- Introduced K to range over types of terms and types of eliminators; adjusted Fig. 4 and related exposition accordingly
- Clarify in the text that \Gamma \vdash \kappa: K is defined as the union of the typing relations for terms and eliminators

### Minor changes

- Added link to GitHub repository and artifact evaluation instructions
- Added link to supplementary materials (extended paper) on arXiv
- Remove mention of representable functors
- Eliminated overloaded metavariables for Galois connections and components of same

### Other notes

- We elected not to distinguish the metalanguage and object language phi; to be consistent, one must also distinguish metalanguage and object language integers, which would be cumbersome.
