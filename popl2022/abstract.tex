   In data visualisation, selections in one chart are sometimes linked to corresponding elements in another related chart. In the visualisation literature this feature is called \emph{brushing and linking}. Although such view coordination features are valuable comprehension aids, they tend be to hard-coded into specific applications or libraries, or require programmer effort. Building on dynamic analysis techniques developed for program slicing, we propose a new bidirectional framework for tracking data dependencies and show how it can support a pervasive, fully automatic brushing and linking mechanism.
