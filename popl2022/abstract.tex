   In data visualisation, so-called \emph{view coordination} features such as brushing and linking, where selections in one chart automatically select corresponding elements in the other, are an important visual comprehension aid. Although such coordination features are widely used, they are are either baked into specific applications, or require programmer effort and must be anticipated in advance by the chart designer. Building on dynamic analysis techniques developed for program slicing, we propose a new bidirectional framework for tracking data dependencies.
