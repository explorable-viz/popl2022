\begin{abstract}
   Geospatial applications like GeoDa and charting libraries like Plotly provide so-called \emph{view coordination} features such as brushing and linking, where selections in one chart automatically select corresponding elements in the other, as an aid to comprehension. Although such coordination features are widely used, they are either baked into specific applications, or require programmer effort and therefore must be anticipated in advance by the chart designer.
