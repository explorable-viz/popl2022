- today: get up to speed with paper and people's availability
- 8 weeks until deadline (8 July)
- check Tomas and Meng can build paper (submodule needed)
- goal: draft by mid-June to send to James Cheney
- "core" of a paper in place:
  - substantial implementation
  - matrix convolution examples
  - formalism + proofs
- still need:
  - write-up: motivation, problem, design decisions, evaluation, ..
    - explain things in terms of "comprehension questions" one might have?
    - but also in terms of slicing
  - additional example & formalisation of "linked" visualisations
    - could use the TypeScript implementation? 
    - are there other idiomatic ways we can use the analysis?
- how to organise moving forward?
