Traces $T$ closely mirror the terms of our language, and are a means of recording the details of program execution and providing an explanation of how a result was computed. These are computed during forward slicing, and allows slicing to then proceed backwards afterwards. Matches $w$ are specifically used to record which pattern was matched against in an eliminator and hence which branch was taken during program execution.
