\section{A bidirectional dynamic dependency analysis}
\label{sec:data-dependencies}

We now extend the core language described in \secref{core-language} with a bidirectional mechanism for tracking data dependencies. The first thing to establish is a way of selecting parts of the program of interest. Consider the \kw{data} field of the bar chart computed in \figref{introduction:data-linking}, which is bound to a list of records; the record corresponding to China is $\exRec{\bind{\kw{x}}{\kw{"China"}} \concat \bind{\kw{y}}{\kw{295.3}}}$. In the example, we selected the value of the field $\kw{y}$ in order to see the corresponding selection on the input.

Our approach to representing selections is shown in \figref{core-syntax-selection}. The basic idea is to parameterise the type $\Set{Val}$ of values by an abstract type $\textcal{A}$ of \emph{annotations}, indicating selection state. We then add an annotation argument to every data constructor, specifying the selection state $\alpha in \textcal{A}$ of the value being constructed. For our present purposes, we are only interested in tracking dependencies between first-order data, so we only add annotation arguments to the constructors for Booleans, integers, records and lists. First-class primitives and closures are not annotated. We do, however, annotate the term constructor corresponding to the annotated values; this allows us to trace data dependencies back to constants that appear in the source code, as described in \secref{surface-language}.

\input{fig/core-language/slicing/syntax}

The abstract type $\textcal{A}$ of annotations is required to be a (finite) lattice: it must have top and bottom elements $\top$ and $\bot$ representing fully selected/unselected, plus meet and join operations $\meet$ and $\join$ for combining selection information, with $\top$ and $\bot$ as their respective units. The Boolean lattice $\textcal{2} \eqdef \langle \TT, \FF, \wedge, \vee\rangle$ can represent the selection above as $\annRec{\bind{\kw{x}}{\annStr{\kw{"China"}}{\FF}} \concat \bind{\kw{y}}{\annInt{\kw{295.3}}{\TT}}}{\FF}$, indicating that the number $\exInt{\kw{295.3}}$ is selected, but neither the string $\exStr{\kw{"China"}}$, nor the record itself, is selected. More interesting lattices such vectors of Booleans can be used to represent multiple selections simultaneously.
